To do that, we first had to get rid of data that was irrelevant and concentrate on the data we could use to bring out interesting facts and come up with some predictions. We decided to remove the first column (which had the names of all of the universities) because the names of the universities are insignificant to the rest of the data if we look at it from a data mining perspective. We also wanted to be able to predict whether or not a school would be public or private based on the rest of the data, and the name is sometimes enough to figure out if it is public or private.\n",
        "The columns we are going to focus on are as follows:\n",
        "1.\tState\n",
        "2.\tGeographic Region\n",
        "3.\tEnrollment\n",
        "4.\tCarnegie Classification\n",
        "5.\tUrbanization\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use this data to put together decision trees and random forest classifiers. For the decision trees, we want to know “Is the school public or private?”. We will give it training data and then evaluate predictions. We have 50 states, so first we will look at how the state impacts the likelihood of a school being public vs. private. For example, if there are 100 schools in Arizona and 98 of them are public, then the likelihood of the test school being public is 98%. If public schools are likely to have more enrollment than private schools, we will find the median value and use that for a branch. Each demographic listed above will likely have an impact on the school’s status.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2) Can we predict the total cost of enrollment (tuition and living) of universities through columns such as admission rate, enrollment rate, etc.?\n",
        "By creating a linear regression model and KNN regressor, we plan to predict the total cost of enrollment for universities. The columns that we are considering for our analysis include: \n",
        "1.\tAdmission Rate  (Calculated by the Applicants total column and the Admissions total column)\n",
        "2.\tEnrollment Rate (Calculated by the Enrolled total column and the Admissions total column)\n",
        "3.\tSAT Percentile Scores \n",
        "4.\tACT Percentile Scores\n",
        "5.\tPercentage Increase in tuition from past years \n",
        "6.\tState the university is in\n",
        "\n",
        "This data is especially helpful for prospective students who are concerned about the financial aspect of their college admissions process. Understanding how much money a school may charge students and which geographic regions are more expensive in their yearly tuition fees can help applicants make more informed decisions about their top schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "###3) Can we use SAT scores data to classify universities within a given geographic region?\n",
        "Currently, for the training data, we have the SAT scores for each university (math, reading, and writing sections) and their geographic region. Based on this data, we attempt to find a correlation and use KNN, decision tree, random forest, cross-validation, and ensemble learning models to classify these scores within a given geographic region. Collectively for a given geographic region, we will use feature engineering to create new features which are more meaningful for possibly predicting the data. Some of the new columns that we might create for classification based learning might include which of the SAT sections has a higher score as compared to others for a given geographic region. For instance, it might be that the Eastern region has higher math SAT scores as compared to reading and writing. Using this information and other column data such as number of students enrolled, accepted, and admitted, we can try to classify whether a given SAT score for an unknown university belongs in one of the appropriate geographic regions provided in the data. \n",
        "\n",
        "This can later be evaluated using techniques such as cross validation, precision, recall, and information gain for a given decision tree that works through the different columns specified above to classify a given SAT score to a particular geographic region. Furthermore, when decision trees are involved, we can use the random forest model to create a bunch of decision trees and use voting to find out which one best segregates or classifies the test data. Cross validation will be used to appropriately take a portion of the data and separate it for testing from the training data. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is important to analyze because it would let us know of the patterns using association rule mining to some extent to figure out if some correlation exists between the data. Through this information, universities that fall in a given geographic region can see what changes they need to make to their study programs to better improve the skills of their students based on the SAT scores. So, if math is a weaker link across a given geographic region with other correlating parameters, then the university can put more foundation math courses to better improve their students’ experience.\n",

Through the linear regression model and KNN regressor model, we hope to predict tuition fees of universities and aim to have an initial accuracy of at least 70% in all the 4 models that we incorporate. We also plan to evaluate the performances of the 4 models and establish the best model that answers the questions that we have asked the data.  "

The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating independence and 1 indicating perfect association. The empirical estimators used for Cramér&#x27;s V have been proved to be biased, even for large samples. We use a bias-corrected measure that has been proposed by Bergsma in 2013 that can be found &lt;a href=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/bergsma/pdf/cramerV3.pdf&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12&quot; id=correlations_tab-phi_k&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 correlation-diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE svg class=&quot;img-responsive center-img&quot;PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot;\n",

We discovered that KNN had the highest precision across the board except for a single instance in \"Carnegie v. Target\" where the recall score of KNN_TFIDF passed the precision score of KNN_TFIDF. \n",

        "Recall and F1-Measures were pretty similar most of the time with each test, but the F1-Measure was consistently at the bottom of the scoreboard.

        "###Question 3: \n",
        "This question focused on how we can use the SAT data to find correlations accordingly between different features and predict a feature with categorical data. Specifically, for the first part (where we used KNN to predict the geographic region), we focused on looking at how the SAT scores vary across different geographic regions. Using the scatter plot initially, it was evident that there was a lot of variance and noisy data, which gave an indication of underfitting/overfitting the model prior to creating the model itself. The only columns selected for this data frame included the SAT scores and the geographic region. \n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, it might be possible that these values are not directly correlated or correlated to a large extent to be able to predict. In fact, if we check this theory with the correlation matrix, in the beginning of the report (profile section), there is very little correlation between the SAT scores and the geographic region directly. The scores are very much spread out across different ranges for each of the geographic regions, so the KNN model was only able to give a performance accuracy of about 50% which is very low. For future purposes, perhaps more values can be included as part of the training data to improve the efficacy of the KNN model and avoid the vagueness or generalization as shown in the scatter plot. \n",
        "\n",
        "The second part of the question was more interesting, where we tried to use the following columns: 'SAT Critical Reading 25th percentile score', 'SAT Critical Reading 75th percentile score', 'SAT Math 25th percentile score', 'SAT Math 75th percentile score', 'SAT Writing 25th percentile score', 'SAT Writing 75th percentile score', 'Percent admitted - total', 'Tuition and fees, 2010-11', 'Tuition and fees, 2011-12', 'Tuition and fees, 2012-13', 'Tuition and fees, 2013-14', 'Geographic region', 'Sector of institution', 'Degree of urbanization (Urban-centric locale)', 'Percent of first-time undergraduates - out-of-state', 'Percent of first-time undergraduates - foreign countries', 'Graduation rate - Bachelor degree within 4 years, total'. The question that we were trying to answer through these set of features was about how the graduation rate of a college is dependent or affected by the geographic region, average tuition fee across the years, SAT scores, and the percentages of first-time undergraduates. \n",
        "\n",
        "This data frame consisted of a mix of continuous and categorical data which allowed for the use of KNN and decision tree classifiers in their own ways. Using both models, we were trying to see how graduation rates are affected. All the columns that were part of this data frame were selected because they were highly correlated to the graduation rate feature which allowed for a much more meaningful model. The performance of the KNN model as compared to the first part of the question changed considerably from 50% to 90% because of choice of better features as part of the data frame and more data which allowed for specific classification and more instances for learning from the training data. Although, it is quite possible that the performance accuracy of 90% is very high for KNN because it might be overfitting, yet this model is far more superior than the one in the first part. \n",
        "\n",
        "5-fold cross validation fit also allowed to learn and use different parts of the training data to get the accuracy. The performance of the decision tree classifier also changed by creating the random forest by a little bit because random forest algorithm randomly selects a subset of features. More importantly, random forest builds multiple trees that consists of voting to get a better set of trees to work with and a larger sample set. "
